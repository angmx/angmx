- 👋 Hi, I’m Angelina Espinoza (Git user: @angmx)
- 👀 I’m interested in researching approaches based on AI for several case studies, such as for identifying financial transactions that are suspicious of committing fraud
      and regulatory compliance. 
  I'd like to test machine learning algorithms in combination with knowledge bases based on OWL-ontologies and performing inferences with reasoners.
- 🌱 I’m interested in implementing ML algorithms and applications for delivering the ML algorithms' outcomes to end-users, such as with Web Apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating AI-based solutions for addressing regulatory compliance in AML and fraud detection
- 📫 How to reach me, just send me a message through LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelina-espinoza-lim%C3%B3n-a219881a/
